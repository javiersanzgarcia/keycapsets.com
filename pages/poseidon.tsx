                            This set originates from my love mythology in partially Ancient greek and the ocean, I
                            started working on this set back in August of 2018, Itâ€™s original concept was to run in the
                            back then the new KAT profile from Keyreative with reserved dyesub, sadly back then reverse
                            dyesub was still something they were working on and decided to hold off and wait for further
                            details. After awhile I started rethinking the concept for a different profile and together
                            with the help of u/Janglad which who I have worked in the past on project like Minimal and
                            Equinox BT, we came with the decision to run Poseidon on the beloved Cherry profile from
                            GMK. as the barebones were already set there was still a lot to do with researching the
                            possibilities within the GMK profile. Here we chose to go with the more traditional
                            Icon+Text modifier legends as they were also used on the vintage Greek cherry keyboards. For
                            the colors we decided to go with GMK stock colors TU1 which is a deep calm and navy blue and
                            TU2 which is a bright cyan that helps with the contrast for more readable legends.
