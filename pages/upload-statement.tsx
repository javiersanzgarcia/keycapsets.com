                    We're sad to announce we are temporarily closing the website for uploads due to incidents that
                    occurred.

                    After a message on subreddit /r/MK (https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) the website
                    received a lot of visitors with lots of favorable reactions and feedback. Unfortunately, some people
                    have abused the free upload pages. Sadly we have no idea who these individuals are and most likely
                    will never know but as a member of this community, I feel heartbroken that these people have the
                    intention of ruining a community platform.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is a valuable learning moment on our part and if this has offended anyone, we sincerely
                    apologize for it.

                    Keycapsets strives to be a community platform for all mechanical keyboard enthusiasts without any
                    harm from outside the hobby. The responses to the Reddit thread indicated that this is a wanted
                    platform that can fill a gap in the community. That is why we decided to continue development.

                    I want to personally thank the people that notified us from the moment it started you're the real
                    MVPs. I also want to thank all the amazing people who came up with amazing ideas to make this
                    platform even better!
                    <br />
                    We are working hard to realize this as soon as possible and hope that in the future this platform
                    can help you find your favorite keycap set!
